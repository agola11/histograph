      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>Histograph is a web application that provides graphical analytics of a userâ€™s browsing history and recommends new websites for a user to browse based on their history and the history of their friends. The fundamental issue at hand is that users do not have a convenient means to understand their browsing history and do not have a way to adjust their browsing habits based on the browsing habits of their peers and others alike.</p>

      <h3>Sunburst Graph</h3>
      <img src="images/gif3.gif" width="75%" height="75%">
      <p>This plot allows the user to dive deeper into his/her browsing history based on URL structure.</p>

      <h3>Directed Graph</h3>
      <img src="images/gif4.gif" width="75%" height="75%">
      <p>This graph allows the user to follow link transitions. A thicker link means more transitions.</p>

      <h3>Line Plot</h3>
      <img src="images/gif5.gif" width="75%" height="75%">
      <p>This plot shows browsing history for different domains across time.</p>

      <h3>Recommendations</h3>
      <img src="images/gif6.gif" width="75%" height="75%">
      <p>This plot allows the user to dive deeper into his/her browsing history based on URL structure.</p>

      <h3>Bubble Graph</h3>
      <img src="images/gif7.gif" width="75%" height="75%">
      <p>This graph allows the user to recursively dive deeper into his/her browsing history and filter URLS he/she doesn't want to send to Histograph.</p>


      <h1>Brief Technical Overview</h1>
      <p>A chrome extension sends browsing history to a Django backend.  Here, the data is cleaned, and parsed into URL tree data structures for each user.  The trees are rendered into formats accepted by the client-side D3.js graphing library.  Collaborative filtering algorithms are run on a user's and friends' trees to generate recommendations; each tree is traversed, and scores are calculated by taking into account similarity of distributions. Caching and pagination were used to improve performance.  For more detail see our <a href = "Histograph_Demo.pptx">presentation</a> or <a href="https://github.com/agola11/histograph">codebase</a>.
